# DSA-Project
The libraries required for this project are: 
1)Tkinter

3)Nappy
4)Networkx

Additional files required to run the code are given in main. They include:
1)A data set named "Bus_data.csv"
2)An image of the bus named "bus.png"

This code can be run on any IDE.

Steps to run the code:

1)Once you run the code, a pop window will appear.

2)There will be an option to select a start stop and an end stop. Please select your stops.

3)There will be a button called calculate, pressing it will displays another window with a printed graph of the shortest route.  The first window shows two more options for book seat and canceling booking.
